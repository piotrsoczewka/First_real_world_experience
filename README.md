# First real world experience

I this repo I am going to show you an exapmle of my first real world application of Python. I used it for processing and analyzing quantitative data and creating images for my recent research paper (which you can check out here: https://www.mdpi.com/1422-0067/22/5/2248). I applied it in several figures in the article. Here, I inclue a jupyter notebook file in which I quantify copper content in various yeast strains and visualise the data with a barplot with indicated statistical differences. I wanted to play a bit with python statistics packages, therefore I compared usage of scipy and pingouin libriaries.

# Tools used in the project

* Python and libraries: Pandas, Seaborn, Scipy and Pingouin.
* Hypothesis testing

# Results

Here is the chart I include in the paper.

The chart shows mean copper content in vaious yeast strain. Error bars represent standard deviation. Obtained results
were analysed by ANOVA followed by Tukeyâ€™s multiple comparison test (n = 3, * p < 0.05, *** p < 0.001).
